    * write the assembler function for mpihelp ....
    * improve iobuf by reading more than one byte at once,
      this shoud espceially done for the buffer in the chain.
    * add a way to difference between errors and eof in the underflow/flush
      function of iobuf.
    * filter all output read from the input when displaying it to the user.
    * remove idea.
    * keyring editing
    * improve the prime number generator
    * remove some debugging stuff (e.g. the listing mode in mainproc)
    * add trust stuff
    * make ttyio.c work (hide passwords etc..)
    * add signal handling
    * add writing of signatures and checking of detached signatures.
    * add option file handling.
    * use correct ASN values for DEK encoding
    * add compress handling
    * add checking of armor trailers
    * fix the memory stuff (secure memory)
    * add real secure memory
    * look for a way to reuse RSA signatures
    * add ElGamal and make it the default one.
    * find a way to remove the arnor filter after it
      has detected, that the data is not armored.
    * Use the Chines Remainder Theorem to speed up RSA calculations.
    * remove all "Fixmes"
    * add credits for the MPI lib.
    * speed up the RIPE-MD-160
